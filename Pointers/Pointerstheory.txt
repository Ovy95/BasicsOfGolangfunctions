Pointer The location at which a vlaue is stored

Pointer Value : The address of a variable

With a pointer we can read or update the value of a variable indirectly

Not every value has an address but every variable does

x:= 1
p:= &x
 
 // *p is a alias for x 

 &x (address of x ): yields a pointer to the integer varable x that is of a values of type *int
