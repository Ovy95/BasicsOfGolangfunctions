Interface is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods.
Writing an interface is simular to writing a class. But a class Describes the attributes and behaviours of an object. And an interface contains behaviours that a class implements 

PolyMorphism 
Is the capability of a method to do diffderent things based on the object that is actign upon.
PolyMorphism allowes you define one interface and have multiple implementations

In Go an interface defines a set of methods that do not contain code (abstract methods); an interface cannot contain variables 

Interface format
Type Name interface {
  method1 (param_list) return_type // no body
  method2 (param_list) return_type //
}
Interfaces in Go normally contain less than four methods 

Real world example of interface A remote control is a type of interface you use the buttons, without knowing whats happening under the hood


Conversion / Type Casting 

Conversion
Narrowing Converting a larger type to a samller like  float 64 to a int 
widening converting a smaller type to a larger  like in to float64

Conversion use 'Strconv' Package the most common numeric conversions are Atoi string to int and Itoa int to string
