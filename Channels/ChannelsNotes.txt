Channels Theory 

Channels must be of the same type an example sending a string to string or int to int 

Two Operations of a channel send and receive (Communications)

c <-x   // Send - Sends a value x to the channel c 
x = <-c // receive - reads from the channels c and saves in variable x 
<-c     // receive - result is discarded

channel support a third operation close()
close sets a flag indicating that no more values will be sent on this channel;
To close a channel: close(ch)

On a closed channel:
Further 'Send' Operations will panic 
Further 'receive' operation receive the already sent values, until no more value are left
after that completion point, any receive operations immediately concludes and yields the zero value of the channel's element type
