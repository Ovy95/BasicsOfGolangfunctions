GoRoutines 

GoRoutines is a lightweight, independently executing function (managed by the Go runtime) that can run concurrently with other activities/ functions.
- When the program starts, the main routine gets created by default
- The main routine is the place that we can create child routines 
- Routines (Including main) are independent
- GoRoutines cannot stop one another, but can communicate and send requests (including stop requests) to one another.
- a go routine has its own stack which grows and shrinks 
- Goroutines are lightweight and many of them can be easily created and run at the same time 

- Use the 'go' statements to create new Goroutines
